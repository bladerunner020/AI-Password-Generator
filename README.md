# Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password using a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. The password length is set to 8 characters by default, but you can adjust this according to your security requirements.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

The script will output a randomly generated password that you can use for your applications or accounts.

## Customization

You can customize the password length by modifying the `password_length` variable in the script:

```python
password_length = 12  # Change 12 to your desired password length
```

Feel free to adjust the character sets used in the password generation by modifying the `lower`, `upper`, `numbers`, and `symbols` variables.
